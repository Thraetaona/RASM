## Introduction
### Name & Logo
RASM ("رسم") is an acronym for '*Ray-tracing Assembler*' or '*Rasterizing Assembler*' depending on the context and also means '*Drawing*' in Persian. \
It explicates '*Tradition*', '*Practical*' or '*Mainstream*' as well. \
Interestingly, in addition to being a short and easy to remember name with relatable translations, it also starts with the first alphabet of the name of the programming language its written in; **R**ust.

RASM's logo (once ready) is supposed to be an orange/yellow lightning bolt resembling a pencil (pencils are usually colored yellow/orange too), which is writing 'RASM' on a paper/surface/board. \
The lightning bolt shape implies RASM's speed and performance, while the pencil (with its eraser) form states its purpose as a monolithic game/rendering engine.

***

### Overview
RASM is a modular and minimalistic web based game engine written in Rust, the engine aims to be as fast as possible while maintaining its safety and portability within the web platform.

it is written in Rust and compiles to a native .wasm (WebAssembly) binary that run and execute inside a modern browser, it is based upon WebGPU and has a javascript modding interface available.

The project uses Github as its infrastructure and basis.  the [Wiki](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM/wiki), [Source Code](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM), [Forums/Issue tracker](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM/issues), [CI](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM/actions), [Releases](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM/releases), [Roadmap](https://github.com/VioletVillain/RASM/projects) And the [Website](https://VioletVillain.github.io/RASM/) Are All Hosted on Github.
